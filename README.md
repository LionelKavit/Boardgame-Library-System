# Boardgame-Library-System
The Board Game Library and Lending System is designed to help board game enthusiasts, clubs, and community centres manage their game collection, track game loans, and provide insights into game popularity and user engagement.

I have used MySQL Workbench and MongoDB-Atlas NoSQL to build and implement this database system.

## Objectives:
1. Maintain a catalog of board games, including details such as name, genre, playtime, age group, and number of players.
2. Track game checkouts, returns, and games loaned for events to ensure proper lending management.
3. Record user information, including borrowing history and preferences.
4. Generate reports on the most borrowed games, user activity, and overdue items.
5. Provide game recommendations based on user preferences.
